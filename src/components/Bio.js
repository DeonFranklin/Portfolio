      <p>
        My name is Deon Franklin. I currently live in San Diego. I am a U.S.
        Navy Veteran and Full-Stack Software Developer. I like to create, design
        and bring ideas to life. My goal as a developer is to learn new
        concepts, practice those concepts to get a better understanding and
        teach those concepts to others as a means of solidifying my
        understanding.
