      <p>My name is Deon Franklin. I currently live in San Diego. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran and Full-Stack Software Developer. I like to create, design and bring ideas to life. My goal as a developer is to learn new concepts, practice those concepts to get a better understanding and teach those concepts to others as a means of solidifying my understanding.</p>
